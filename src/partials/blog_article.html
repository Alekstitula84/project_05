        Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
        music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for
        gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail
        retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them
        feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
      </p>
      <p class="article__text">
        However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
        have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
        the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
